Hi, 

note : English is not my first language, so this text may contains lot of errors and weird sentences.

So, the context : I was looking for a tool to help me train and memorize my opener, so i created a simple one.

Done it with C# WPF, i'm still learning C# and Visual Studio Environment, so don't expect a "triple A" application, it may contains some bugs.

Here is the link, c# src (VS2013 free edition) & exe :

How to :

- Just unzip where you want and launch KeyboardSequenceTester.exe in \bin\Release\

The combobox shows all sequences you'll define in the sequences.xml file, in "Resources" folder.

Click Start (or press space) to start the sequence, a timer will start, you need to follow and complete your keyboard sequence before the timer reach the "timer" attribute value, in the associated sequence xml node.

Once you pressed all the shortcuts, the timer will stop and you'll see how much seconds it tokes to you. 

The green bar turns red : 

- when you take too much time to complete the sequence.

- if "Exact" is checked and you press incorrect shortcut

"Exact" option : you need to strictly follow the sequence, any wrong shortcut = fail.

"OnKeyDown" option : if checked, keyboard events are captured on KeyDown, else on KeyUp.


Now, all you have to do is change the sequences.xml file to create your own sequences.

I guess the original xml is enough to see how it works, but let's explain a bit, if needed :

Each sequences needs a list of <skill>, and each <skill> needs to be declared in the <skills> node.
<skill> need these attributes :
- "name" : it's the name used for the reference in <sequence><key skill="skill_name" />..., be sure to not create double, names are ID, multiple skills with the same name may generate weird behavior.
- "icon" : name of icon for the skill, in icons folder
- "shortcut" : the keyboard shortcut you use for this skill.
To know how to translate a specific shortcut into the good string, just start a sequence, press your shortcut, and see how it's written into the big text area.
- "castingtime" : not used yet, but later i'm planning to handle pseudo casting time with ogcd and gcd behavior


In icons folder there's not all the game skills icons, there's only jobs + mch's skills, feel free to add the one you want but try to the same format (replacing space by "_", no special characters).

Enjoy,

If any suggestion or question, feel free to ask.

ps : i'm doing this on my free time, so please be patient and not too much demanding for features :)
